# Basics of HTML: SEO and Accessibility
This project provides a foundational HTML document designed to illustrate key concepts of modern web development: HTML5 semantic structure, web accessibility, and basic search engine optimization (SEO). It serves as a practical example for anyone learning how to build web pages that are not only functional but also user-friendly and discoverable.

## Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate how to create a simple, semantically correct web page that prioritizes both human and machine readability. It showcases the importance of thoughtful HTML structure for improving navigation for assistive technologies (accessibility) and optimizing content for search engine crawlers (SEO).

## Features
**HTML5 Semantic Structure:** Utilizes modern HTML5 semantic tags like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, and <footer> to provide clear meaning and structure to the content.

**Accessibility Best Practices:** Incorporates elements and attributes designed to enhance usability for screen readers and other assistive technologies, such as:

    * lang="en" for language declaration.

    * aria-label for navigation elements.

    * Descriptive alt attributes for images.

    * Logical heading hierarchy (<h1> through <h3>).

Basic SEO Principles: Applies fundamental on-page SEO techniques to make the content more discoverable by search engines, including:

    * A concise and descriptive <title> tag.

    * Relevant <meta name="description"> and <meta name="keywords"> (for basic understanding).

    * Structured content with appropriate heading tags.

**Clear Content Organization:** The page is logically divided into sections for easy navigation and understanding of different topics related to HTML, SEO, and Accessibility.
